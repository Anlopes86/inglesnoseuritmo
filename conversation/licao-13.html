                    <p>The man the authorities came to blame</p>
                    <p>For somethin' that he never done</p>
                    <p>Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been the champion of the world</p>
                    <p>Four months later, the ghettos are in flame</p>
                    <p>Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name</p>
                    <p>While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game</p>
                    <p>And the cops are puttin' the screws to him, lookin' for somebody to blame</p>
                    <p>"Remember that murder that happened in a bar?"</p>
                    <p>"Remember you said you saw the getaway car?"</p>
                    <p>"You think you'd like to play ball with the law?"</p>
                    <p>"Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin' that night?"</p>
                    <p>"Don't forget that you are white"</p>
                    <p>Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure"</p>
                    <p>Cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break.</p>
                    <p>We got you for the motel job and we're talkin' to your friend Bello.</p>
                    <p>Now you don't wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.</p>
                    <p>You'll be doin' society a favor. That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver.</p>
                    <p>We want to put his ass in stir. We want to pin this triple murder on him.</p>
                    <p>He ain't no Gentleman Jim"</p>
                    <p>Rubin could take a man out with just one punch</p>
                    <p>But he never did like to talk about it all that much</p>
                    <p>It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay</p>
                    <p>And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way</p>
                    <p>Up to some paradise</p>
                    <p>Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice</p>
                    <p>And ride a horse along a trail</p>
                    <p>But then they took him to the jailhouse</p>
                    <p>Where they try to turn a man into a mouse</p>
                    <p>All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance</p>
                    <p>The <input type="text" class="w-24 border-b-2 text-center bg-transparent border-gray-500"> <button class="answer-btn" data-answer="trial"><i class="fas fa-eye"></i></button> was a pig-circus, he never had a chance</p>
                    <p>The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums</p>
                    <p>To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum</p>
                    <p>And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger</p>
                    <p>No one doubted that he pulled the trigger</p>
                    <p>And though they could not produce the gun</p>
                    <p>The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed</p>
                    <p>And the all-white jury agreed</p>
                    <p>Rubin Carter was falsely tried</p>
                    <p>The crime was murder "one," guess who testified?</p>
                    <p>Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied</p>
                    <p>And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride</p>
                    <p>How can the life of such a man</p>
                    <p>Be in the palm of some fool's hand?</p>
                    <p>To see him obviously framed</p>
                    <p>Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land</p>
                    <p>Where justice is a <input type="text" class="w-24 border-b-2 text-center bg-transparent border-gray-500"> <button class="answer-btn" data-answer="game"><i class="fas fa-eye"></i></button></p>
                    <p>Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties</p>
                    <p>Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise</p>
                    <p>While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell</p>
                    <p>An innocent man in a living hell</p>
                    <p>That's the story of the Hurricane, but it won't be over till they clear his name</p>
                    <p>And give him back the time he's done</p>
                    <p>Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been the champion of the world</p>
